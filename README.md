## Frequently Asked Questions
= Thumb and Title not able to float left =
Check the option in the Thumbnails panels > "Show thumbnails above text".
Then add this custom CSS. If you use wordpress 4.7 or higher you can add this custom CSS with the customizer ([Easily adding custom CSS using the Theme customizer](http://kometschuh.de/Easily-adding-custom-CSS-using-the-WordPress-Theme-customizer.html)):

.cat-post-thumbnail {
	float: left !important;
}

= The font-size is different from that of other widgets or Theme elements? =
Please use the option: "Disable widget CSS".

### I want the title as a link pointing to the selected Categorie page? =
Enable the check box "Make widget title link".

### Parse error: syntax error, unexpected T_FUNCTION in /home/www/blog/wp-content/plugins/category-posts/cat-posts.php on line 58 =
Some of the features that were used in that version needs PHP 5.3+.
We apologies for any headache this may cause you, but frankly it is better for you to check with your hosting company how can you upgrade the PHP version that you are using, and not only in order to use this plugin. PHP 5.2 should be considered insecure now, and for your own sake you should upgrade.
PHP 5.2 is very old and any support for it from the php developers had ended more then 5 years ago [php.net/eol.php](http://php.net/eol.php).
We know there are peopel how use PHP 5.2 [wordpress.org/about/stats](https://wordpress.org/about/stats/) and we can't imagine this people will have no other problems, if they don't update.

### You check the PHP version with phpversion(), but the widget don't work
Check also the .htaccess file, if there is an entry for an older PHP version.

1. The widget configuration dialog.
2. Front end of the widget using a default WordPress Theme.
